## Code of Conduct

Contributors are not expected to be programming professionals, but they are expected to behave in a professional manner. Offensive behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. Please refer to [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/) for a more detailed set of general rules.

## Contributing guidelines

You can contribute to this project in several ways.

### Reporting issues

The easiest way to contribute is to __report bugs and other issues__ that you have encountered when using the end-product. When reporting an issue:
1. Make sure that someone has not already reported the same issue by checking through the preciously reported issues.
2. Give detailed information about the environment and circumstances in which you encountered the issue. This includes at least:
    - Operating system
    - Browser type and version
    - Platform (Moodle etc.)
3. What you were doing when you encountered the error.
4. What happened and what did you expect to happen.
5. Any possible web console__ error messages related to the issue.

### Suggesting features

Suggestions for new features are welcome. Please note however, that it is impossible to implement all suggested features, and you should not take it personally if your suggestion is rejected. In case of conflicting ideas the need of the many usually outweigh the need of the few. You can submit suggestions using the _issue system_, but please make it clear you are not reporting an actual issue (by writing _Suggestion:_ in front of the title, for example).

### Pull requests

If you have fixed an issue or developed a new feature, you can submit if for review as a _pull request_. It is generally advisable to discuss any prospective pull requests in advance, to avoid several people working on the same issue or developing an incompatible feature.
