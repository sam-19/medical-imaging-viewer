Medical Imaging Study Viewer
============================

## Description

This is a Javascript application for viewing medical imaging studies in the browser, using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as interface framework. The development of this application was supported by [University of Eastern Finland](https://www.uef.fi/en) using [Finnish MEDigi project](https://www.medigi.fi/en/home-page.html) funding.

The original aim of this application was to provide a way to view radiological imaging studies in [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) and to this end, there are additional Moodle plugins for [linking image resources](https://github.com/sam-19/medimg-viewer-moodle-atto-editor-plugin) and [displaying them](https://github.com/sam-19/medimg-viewer-moodle-filter) as components in Moodle documents.

In addition to the master branch, there are a couple of experiments for including electrophysiological studies in the dev branch. In addition to these features falling outside the scope of the application, the implementations themselves turned out to be non-viable, but they are included as per the terms of my contract with the university.

Due to the restrictive schedule of the master project quite a few corners had to be cut while developing this application, leaving a considerable maintenance debt. As a result, active development of this application has been discontinued in favor of a completely rewritten version TBA soon.

That said, there are some outstanding issues that I will be willing to patch, should anyone find solutions to them.

## Usage

An example distribution is available as a 0.1 release. The chunk loader requires that you serve all files from the same location.

The application can open individual DICOM images or image series (such as CT image stacks). Open the files by dragging them onto the file drop area on then left side panel. Files can be added either individually, or in a folder. Several studies can be loaded at once and organized into separate visits. The application support the following folder struture:
```
üìÅ Root folder (folder name irrelevant)
 -  üìÅ Visit #1 (folder name is displayed in the app)
     -  üìÅ Single X-ray study (folder name is displayed in the app)
         -  üìÑ X_RAY_1.dcm (file name irrelevant)
     -  üìÅ Multiple image stack (folder name is displayed in the app)
         -  üìÑ CT_IMG_1.dcm (file name irrelevant)
         -  üìÑ CT_IMG_2.dcm (file name irrelevant)
         ...
         -  üìÑ CT_IMG_N.dcm (file name irrelevant)
 -  üìÅ Visit #2 (folder name is displayed in the app)
     ...

```
The active visit can be changed from the top left corder dropdown. Once a study has been loaded, additional files and folders dropped onto the file drop area are added as new visits.

## External libraries and resources

Development of this sapplication would not have been possible without numerous open source Javascript libraries and the tremendous contributions of their developers. The most important external libraries used in this project are:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Cornerstone.js](https://cornerstonejs.org/) and its submodules
  - CornerstoneMath
  - CornerstoneTools
  - DicomParser
  - WADOImageLoader
- [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) (as a dependency of Cornerstone.js)
